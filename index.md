## INTRODUCTION

This application is a project of the course Developing Data Products, Data Science Specilization.

It will get some car attributes from users and predict the value of Miles Per Galon (MPG) of that car.

The code (ui.R and server.r) are located at https://github.com/pumpkin78/DevDataProd

## Dataset

This application uses the dataset Motor Trend Car Road Tests, "mtcars", included in R installation.



```r
data (mtcars)
head(mtcars, 5)
```

```

## INPUT - HOW TO USE

Users have to provide the attributes of the car she/he wants to predict the MPG:   
1) Number of cylinders (cyl) within the range between 2 and 10  
2) Gross horsepower (hp)  
3) Tranmission Type: select either "Automatic" or "Manual"  
4) Weight of the car  

Then click on "Submit" button. The web user interface will send the information to the server to calculate and then send back the result to the user interface.

---

## OUTPUT

The server predict the MPG based on a the input and an internal linear regression model and output the predicted MPG on the output panel. In order for users to understand a bigger picture, the application also presents a plot of predicted MPGs v.s. Weight given the same values of number of cylinders, gross horsepower and transmission type.

---

## LIMITATION & FUTURE WORK

1) Fixed simple internal linear regression model. This could be upgraded for users to select regression models.

2) This application uses the old dataset "mtcars" which is not up-to-date.
